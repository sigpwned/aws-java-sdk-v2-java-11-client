# aws-java-sdk-v2-java-nio-client

An implementation of the [AWS Java SDK v2 HTTP Client SPI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/latest/developer-guide/http-configuration.html) using [the Java 11 HttpClient](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.net.http/java/net/http/HttpClient.html).

It was pulled from the [@aws/aws-java-sdk-v2](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java-v2) [java-11-http-client](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java-v2/tree/java-11-http-client) branch.

It is very much a work in progress. Hopefully, there will be a Maven release soon.
